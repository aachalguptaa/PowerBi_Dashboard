# PowerBi_Dashboard
I recently worked on two exciting data analysis projects using Power BI, where I applied concepts of data cleaning, modeling, and visualization to turn raw data into meaningful insights.

ðŸ”¹ Amazon Prime Video Dashboard â€“ analyzed content trends by genre, release year, and ratings to understand the entertainment industry better.
ðŸ”¹ Airbnb Dashboard â€“ explored pricing patterns, reviews, and neighborhood performance to study trends in the hospitality sector.

Through these projects, I learned how data analysis and business understanding go hand in hand â€” helping me gain insights into both the entertainment and travel industries.

This experience also strengthened my skills in Power BI, DAX, and data storytelling.
Excited to keep growing in the field of data analytics and business intelligence!
